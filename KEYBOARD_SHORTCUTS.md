# Keyboard Shortcuts - Text Animation

This document describes the keyboard shortcuts available in text animation mode (`-as text`).

## Implementation Summary

The text animation now supports the same keyboard shortcuts as the terminal-based animations (terminal_map, terminal_console, terminal_stats). All shortcuts are defined in `ridehail/keyboard_mappings.py` and handled by `ridehail.simulation.KeyboardHandler`.

## Available Shortcuts

| Key | Action | Description |
|-----|--------|-------------|
| `p` or `space` | Pause/Resume | Pause or resume the simulation |
| `s` | Step | Execute single simulation step (only when paused) |
| `r` | Restart | Restart simulation from beginning |
| `n` | Decrease Vehicles | Decrease vehicle count by 1 |
| `N` | Increase Vehicles | Increase vehicle count by 1 |
| `k` | Decrease Demand | Decrease demand by 0.1 |
| `K` | Increase Demand | Increase demand by 0.1 |
| `d` | Decrease Delay | Decrease animation delay by 0.05s |
| `D` | Increase Delay | Increase animation delay by 0.05s |
| `q` | Quit | Exit the simulation |

## User Feedback

When shortcuts are used, the text animation prints feedback messages on new lines:

```
[Paused - press space/p to resume, s to step, r to restart]
[Vehicles increased to 6]
[Demand set to 1.20]
[Animation delay set to 0.15s]
[Restarted simulation]
```

These messages appear above the status line, which continues to update normally with `\r` (carriage return) to show the current simulation state.

## Technical Details

### Implementation

1. **State Tracking**: The `TextAnimation` class tracks previous values of:
   - Vehicle count (`_prev_vehicle_count`)
   - Base demand (`_prev_base_demand`)
   - Animation delay (`_prev_animation_delay`)
   - Block index (`_prev_block_index`)

2. **Change Detection**: The `_check_and_print_keyboard_actions()` method:
   - Compares current values with previous values
   - Prints feedback messages when changes are detected
   - Uses `\n` for feedback (new line) to preserve the single-line status display

3. **Integration**: Called at the start of each simulation loop iteration, after keyboard input checking but before simulation step execution.

### Code Location

- Main implementation: `ridehail/animation/text.py`
  - `TextAnimation.__init__()`: Initialize state tracking
  - `TextAnimation._check_and_print_keyboard_actions()`: Detect and report changes
  - `TextAnimation.animate()`: Integration into simulation loop

- Keyboard handling: `ridehail/simulation.py`
  - `KeyboardHandler`: Centralized keyboard input processing
  - All action logic (pause, restart, adjust parameters, etc.)

- Keyboard mappings: `ridehail/keyboard_mappings.py`
  - Single source of truth for all keyboard shortcuts
  - Shared across text, terminal, and browser interfaces

## Testing

Run the validation script:
```bash
python test_text_keyboard.py
```

Manual testing:
```bash
python run.py test.config -as text
# Try each keyboard shortcut and verify feedback messages appear
```

## Comparison with Terminal Animations

| Feature | Text Mode | Terminal Mode (Textual) |
|---------|-----------|------------------------|
| Keyboard shortcuts | Same | Same |
| Feedback mechanism | Text messages | Visual UI updates |
| Underlying handler | `KeyboardHandler` | `KeyboardHandler` (via UI actions) |
| Configuration source | `keyboard_mappings.py` | `keyboard_mappings.py` |

Both modes use the same centralized keyboard handling logic, ensuring consistent behavior across all animation styles.
