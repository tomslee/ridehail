The report is [here](https://archive.sfcta.org/sites/default/files/content/Planning/TNCs/TNCs_Today_112917.pdf). In the report, &ldquo;Out-of-service VMT [vehicle miles travelled] refers to the vehicle miles traveled while circulating to pickup a passenger.&rdquo; It is not clear if this includes P3 time and distance.

> Approximately 20% of total TNC VMT are out-of-service miles. This is significantly lower than the more than 40% of taxi VMT that are out-of-service miles&#x2026; The greater efficiencies of TNCs, as
> reflected in a lower share of out-of-service miles, are likely
> primarily a reflection of the larger fleets of TNC drivers operating on the road at any given time, enabling shorter distances to pickup locations. 

Table 4 (weekdays) is similar to tables 5 and 6 (weekends).

The data used in this study was collected from the Uber API. &ldquo;Sending a request to the API returns a text file response containing this information [nearby vehicle locations, estimated times-to-pickup, and more]. I am sceptical of the data here.
