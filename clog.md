# Textual Migration Status and Continuation Prompt

I'm working on a ridehail simulation project that uses Rich-based terminal animations. I have successfully implemented a migration from Rich to Textual framework for enhanced terminal UIs. Here's the current status:

## What's Been Completed ✅

**Phase 1: Foundation (Complete)**
- Created `TextualBasedAnimation` base class in `ridehail/animation/textual_base.py`
- Updated animation factory in `ridehail/animation/utils.py` to support `use_textual` parameter
- Added `use_textual` configuration parameter to `ridehail/config.py` with `-tx` command-line flag
- Factory gracefully falls back to Rich animations if Textual unavailable

**Phase 2: Console Migration (Complete)**
- Implemented `TextualConsoleAnimation` in `ridehail/animation/textual_console.py`
- Full feature parity with Rich console: all progress bars, metrics, and configuration display
- Enhanced interactivity: real-time parameter adjustment, simulation controls, keyboard shortcuts
- Fixed critical dispatch object bug: changed `dispatch=getattr(self.sim, 'dispatch', None)` to `dispatch=self.dispatch`

## Current Working Status

**✅ Working Commands:**
```bash
# Rich console (old):
python run.py test.config -as console

# Textual console (new):
python run.py test.config -as console -tx
```

**✅ Configuration File Approach:**
- `textual_test.config` exists with `use_textual = True`, `animation_style = console`, `animate = True`

## Current Debugging Status - CRITICAL FINDING

**ISSUE IDENTIFIED**: The `simulation_step()` callback is **never being executed** despite `self.set_interval()` completing successfully.

### Debugging Evidence:
1. **UI Renders Correctly**: Textual interface displays properly with panels and progress bars
2. **Timer Creation Succeeds**: `self.set_interval()` returns without error
3. **No Callback Execution**: Debug prints in `simulation_step()` never appear, even when redirected to files
4. **Title Shows Static**: Title remains "Ridehail Simulation - Textual test" instead of updating with block progress

### Root Cause Analysis:
The issue is NOT with progress bar rendering or data flow - it's that the **timer callback is never being invoked**. This suggests:
- `self.set_interval()` in Textual may not work as expected with `repeat=0`
- The timer may be getting cancelled immediately
- The callback function reference may be incorrect
- Event loop scheduling issue

### Next Debugging Steps:
1. **Test Timer with Simple Callback**: Create minimal test with just title updates
2. **Check Timer Parameters**: Try different interval values and repeat settings
3. **Alternative Timer Methods**: Use Textual's `call_later()` or `call_repeatedly()` instead
4. **Event Loop Investigation**: Check if simulation blocks the Textual event loop

### Technical Details Added:
- Enhanced logging to `/tmp/textual_debug.log` to bypass terminal control sequence interference
- Confirmed `start_simulation()` is called from `on_mount()`
- Verified `self.set_interval()` returns a Timer object without exceptions

## Next Phase Ready

**Phase 3: Terminal Map Migration** is ready to begin once console issues are resolved. This involves migrating `TerminalMapAnimation` to Textual with enhanced interactive map features.

## File Structure
```
ridehail/animation/
├── textual_base.py          # Base Textual animation class
├── textual_console.py       # Enhanced console with interactivity
├── utils.py                 # Updated factory with use_textual support
└── (future: textual_map.py) # Next phase
```

## Key Technical Details

**Critical Bug Fix Applied:**
In both `textual_base.py` and `textual_console.py`, the `sim.next_block()` call was corrected from:
```python
dispatch=getattr(self.sim, 'dispatch', None)  # WRONG
```
to:
```python
dispatch=self.dispatch  # CORRECT
```

**Configuration Integration:**
- Command-line flag `-tx` properly toggles Textual mode
- Backward compatibility maintained with Rich as default
- Factory pattern enables seamless switching

## Debugging Request

Please help debug why the user sees the Textual interface but no simulation progress, while the same code shows working progress bars in my tests. The user is using `uv run run.py textual_test.config -tx` and sees the UI render but progress bars remain at 0%.
