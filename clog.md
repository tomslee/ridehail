# Textual Migration Status and Progress Log

I'm working on a ridehail simulation project that uses Rich-based terminal animations. I have successfully implemented a migration from Rich to Textual framework for enhanced terminal UIs. Here's the current status:

## What's Been Completed ✅

**Phase 1: Foundation (Complete)**
- Created `TextualBasedAnimation` base class in `ridehail/animation/textual_base.py`
- Updated animation factory in `ridehail/animation/utils.py` to support `use_textual` parameter
- Added `use_textual` configuration parameter to `ridehail/config.py` with `-tx` command-line flag
- Factory gracefully falls back to Rich animations if Textual unavailable

**Phase 2: Console Migration (Complete - FIXED!)**
- Implemented `TextualConsoleAnimation` in `ridehail/animation/textual_console.py`
- Full feature parity with Rich console: all progress bars, metrics, and configuration display
- Enhanced interactivity: real-time parameter adjustment, simulation controls, keyboard shortcuts
- **MAJOR FIX**: Resolved dispatch attribute access issue by passing animation instance to Textual apps

## Current Working Status ✅

**✅ Working Commands:**
```bash
# Rich console (old):
python run.py dispatch.config -as console

# Textual console (new):
python run.py dispatch.config -as console -tx
```

**✅ Configuration File Approach:**
- `textual_test.config` exists with `use_textual = True`, `animation_style = console`, `animate = True`

## MAJOR BUG RESOLUTION - December 2024

**ISSUE RESOLVED**: Fixed "TextualConsoleApp object has no attribute 'dispatch'" error.

### Problem Analysis:
The issue was architectural - the Textual apps (`RidehailTextualApp`, `TextualConsoleApp`) are separate Textual App classes that don't inherit from the animation classes, so they didn't have access to the `dispatch` attribute that's created in `RideHailAnimation.__init__()`.

### Solution Implemented:
1. **Pass Animation Instance**: Updated app constructors to accept `animation` parameter:
   ```python
   # In TextualBasedAnimation.create_app():
   return RidehailTextualApp(self.sim, animation=self)

   # In TextualConsoleAnimation.create_app():
   return TextualConsoleApp(self.sim, animation=self)
   ```

2. **Store Animation Reference**: Updated `RidehailTextualApp.__init__()`:
   ```python
   def __init__(self, sim, animation=None, **kwargs):
       super().__init__(**kwargs)
       self.sim = sim
       self.animation = animation  # NEW: Store animation instance
   ```

3. **Access Through Animation**: Updated simulation step methods:
   ```python
   # OLD (failed):
   dispatch=self.dispatch

   # NEW (works):
   dispatch=self.animation.dispatch
   ```

### Files Modified:
- `ridehail/animation/textual_base.py`: Added animation parameter, updated simulation_step
- `ridehail/animation/textual_console.py`: Updated create_app and simulation_step methods

### Current State:
- ✅ Textual console animation now properly accesses dispatch object
- ✅ Simulation progresses correctly with real-time updates
- ✅ All configuration parameters available through `self.animation.*`
- ✅ Full backward compatibility maintained with Rich animations

## UI ENHANCEMENT COMPLETED - January 2025 ✅

**ENHANCED MEAN VEHICLE COUNT DISPLAY**: Successfully replaced the inappropriate ProgressBar-based Mean Vehicle Count display with a superior Sparkline + numeric value combination.

### Problem Solved:
- **Issue**: Mean Vehicle Count was using a ProgressBar which implied percentage completion and had no logical total value
- **Solution**: Implemented Sparkline widget showing trend over smoothing_window + numeric vehicle count

### Implementation Details:
1. **Replaced ProgressBar with Sparkline**:
   - Shows vehicle count trend over time using smoothing_window history
   - Displays current count as rounded integer (e.g., "141" instead of "141.4")

2. **Layout Improvements**:
   - **Horizontal Layout**: All progress bar labels moved from above to left of bars for 2x space efficiency
   - **Consistent Styling**: Vehicle count display integrated inline with other progress sections
   - **Alignment**: Sparkline and value positioned to approximately match ProgressBar layout

3. **Technical Implementation**:
   - Vehicle count history tracking in `EnhancedProgressPanel` with `results_window` length
   - Sparkline data updates on each simulation step
   - Custom CSS for compact horizontal layout with `.progress-row`, `.progress-label` classes

### Files Modified:
- `ridehail/animation/textual_console.py`: Complete layout overhaul and Sparkline integration

### Current Layout:
```
Block Progress     ████████████████░░░░ 64%
P1 (Idle)         ████████████████░░░░ 74%
P2 (Dispatched)   ███░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ 15%
P3 (Occupied)     ██░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ 11%
Mean Wait Time    ███░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ 17%
Mean Ride Time    ██░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ 11%
Forward Dispatches███░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ 29%
Vehicles          [sparkline chart]   141
```

### Notes:
- Sparkline vs ProgressBar alignment is "close enough" - perfect alignment prevented by fundamental widget differences in Textual
- Vehicle count now shows meaningful trend information instead of confusing progress metaphor

## Next Phase Ready

**Phase 3: Terminal Map Migration** is ready to begin. This involves migrating `TerminalMapAnimation` to Textual with enhanced interactive map features.

## File Structure
```
ridehail/animation/
├── textual_base.py          # Base Textual animation class ✅
├── textual_console.py       # Enhanced console with interactivity ✅
├── utils.py                 # Updated factory with use_textual support ✅
└── (future: textual_map.py) # Next phase
```

## Key Technical Details

**Architecture Pattern Established:**
- Animation classes (`TextualConsoleAnimation`) inherit from `TextualBasedAnimation` → `RideHailAnimation`
- App classes (`TextualConsoleApp`) inherit from Textual's `App`
- Apps receive animation instance via constructor to access all config attributes
- This pattern enables Textual apps to access the full rich simulation state

**Critical Fix Applied:**
The `dispatch` object (and all other simulation config) is now properly accessible to Textual apps through:
```python
# In Textual app methods:
results = self.sim.next_block(
    dispatch=self.animation.dispatch,  # Access config through animation
    # ... other parameters
)
```

**Configuration Integration:**
- Command-line flag `-tx` properly toggles Textual mode
- Backward compatibility maintained with Rich as default
- Factory pattern enables seamless switching
- All existing `.config` files work with both Rich and Textual modes
