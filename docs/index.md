# Notes about the project

See [Toronto](toronto.md) for simulations of Toronto.

See [Cities](cities.md) for links to data about other cities. I should
split this up.

See [Background](background.md) and [Notes](notes.md) for what they say (in-progress).

See [Benchmark](benchmark.md) for notes on internals and performance.
