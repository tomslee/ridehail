            <h4>A starting point</h4>
            <p>
                First, let's see if this rough model can simulate a city like Toronto. Toronto is an area of 630km^2, modelled here as a 60*60 square city, with an average speed of 30 km/h, and each block representing one minute of travel. From p25 of

                (VFH2), on Feb 6 2020 the ridehail market in Toronto was like this:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    194,000 trips (average 135/min)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Average trip length of 8km (16 mins).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Vehicle phases: 40.5% P1, 11.2% P2, 48.3% P3.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Average wait time 2.1 minutes. This does not include the time between the driver "arriving" and the trip starting, so the time in this model should be a couple of minutes longer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Estimated average number of active vehicles: 6000 (eyeballing a chart).
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Using random trips, with a maximum length of 40mins (average trip length of 20 minutes), the chart shows that the simple model gets the P3 fraction right, but underestimates P2.

                for informal notes on data sources. The charts are generated by the desktop version of the model.

            <h4>Many trips take place in downtown Toronto</h4>
            <p>
                One additional step is to introduce two "zones": a downtown zone of 30 blocks by 30 blocks, in which more trip requests are made. Here, 40% more trip requests per block come from this downtown zone than from the outside areas - all other aspects remain the same. This one additional parameter gives the right P2 values. This seems to be the simplest model of a city that reproduces the broad features of a ride hail market or system.

            <h4>Supply and demand </h4>
            <p>
                A distinguishing feature of ridehail systems is that drivers are free to enter and leave at any time. Here, drivers will enter if they can earn more than a "reservation wage" and leave if the current pay is less. Driver earnings is the fare, minus the platform commission, multiplied by the fraction of time they are driving (P3).
            </p>
            <p>
                The fare in Toronto in 2020 is about $0.18/min and $0.81/km (
                <a href="http://taxihowmuch.com/location/toronto-on-ca">source</a>
                ), which equates to $0.58 per minute total. In addition there is a base fare (booking fee) that does not go to the driver (see
                <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/uber-drivers-upfront-fares-1.3973342">this CBC article</a>
                , and so is not included here. Uber's commission is often said to be 25%.
            </p>
            <p>
                The chart at right shows that, to sustain 6000 drivers at P3=48%, drivers must have a reservation wage (before any expenses) of $0.22 per minute, which is equivalent to $13/hour. Out of this must come vehicle expenses: if those are $0.20/km (the CRA suggestion is higher, at $0.50, but drivers do drive less when waiting for a ride, so this is a guess), which is $6/hr, then drivers are ending up with an income of $7/hr.

            <h4>Lowering the platform commission </h4>
            <p>
                If Uber decides to attract more drivers, it has several levers it can use. One is to lower its commission. What is the effect of a lower commission on driver income? It sounds like it should lead to higher incomes, but that's not what happens. Instead, the higher pay per ride attracts more drivers, so the fraction of time each driver is busy goes down until their income is the same reservation wage as before.
            </p>
            <p>
                The lowered commission and consequent increase in vehicle numbers (from 6400 to 7200 in these runs) does lower wait times, but only marginally, reducing them by about 10%.

            <h4>Raising the platform commission </h4>
            <p>
                Going the other way, if Uber decides it needs to make more money and raises the commission, the number of vehicles falls (to 5700), each vehicle is busier so that each driver makes the same hourly wage as before, and the wait time is increased, again only slightly.
            </p>
            <p>
                The effect of fare and commission on demand for rides is not considered here.
